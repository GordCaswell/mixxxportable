.. admonition:: What is launcher.ini?

   The PortableApps.com Launcher is a universal launcher; it can make almost
   anything portable, but it needs to be told what to do so that it can make an
   application portable. It gets this information from a file called
   ``launcher.ini`` which is stored in the ``App\AppInfo`` directory of the
   portable application package.

Releases

   Development Test
      A test release of a portable application, generally of alpha or beta
      quality. When a portable application is first developed, it bears this
      label; in appinfo.ini, its ``DisplayVersion`` should end with
      ``Development Test N``, where N is the Development Test release number.
      The Development Test release number starts at 1 and should go back down
      to 1 again if there is a new release of the base application. These
      releases may be very buggy and may also contain malware and so it is
      generally a good idea to scan them before testing.

   Pre-Release
      A release of a portable application after it has gone through the
      :term:`Development Test` stage, just before it becomes an :term:`official
      PortableApps.com release`. Generally stable and deemed ready for release
      after. In appinfo.ini, its ``DisplayVersion`` should end with
      ``Pre-Release N``, where N is the Pre-Release release number. The
      Pre-Release release number starts at 1 and should go back down to 1 again
      if there is a new release of the base application. After final testing,
      the application will be made an :term:`official PortableApps.com
      release`.

   Official PortableApps.com release
      Once an application has passed through testing as a :term:`Development
      Test` and as a :term:`Pre-Release`, it is released officialy at
      PortableApps.com as a supported portable application. It will have its
      own :term:`splash screen` (see :ref:`splash-screen` for details). The
      ``DisplayVersion`` in appinfo.ini should not have any appendage unless a
      :term:`revision` is released.

   Revision
      If an :term:`official PortableApps.com release` is found to have problems
      or new features must be added for compatibility with the PortableApps.com
      Platform, or for some other reason, a revision is released. The only
      difference in the released package is that the ``DisplayVersion`` in
      appinfo.ini will have ``Revision N`` added to it. The revision number
      starts at 2.

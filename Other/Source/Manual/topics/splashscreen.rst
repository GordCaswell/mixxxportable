Splash screens
==============

PortableApps.com applications usually have a splash screen. This file goes in ``App\AppInfo\splash.jpg`` and must be a JPEG image. The usual procedure is to use the `black and white PortableApps.com Development Test Release splash screen <http://portableapps.com/files/images/development/SplashDevelopmentTestRelease.jpg>`_ while an application is a :term:`Development Test` and then when it is deemed ready to become a :term:`Pre-Release`, it will be given its own one ready for becoming an :term:`official PortableApps.com release`.

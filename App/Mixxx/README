http://www.mixxx.org


* ABOUT ****************************************************
Mixxx is open source software for DJ'ing. You can use MP3s, 
Ogg Vorbis files, and other formats as audio input. Mixxx
can be controlled through the GUI and with external 
controllers including MIDI devices, and more.
This release works on Linux, Windows and MacOS X.

Mixxx is released under GPL v2. See LICENSE file in this 
directory for a copy of the licence.


* NEWS *****************************************************

* UPGRADING ************************************************

We recommend deleting your old skins directory before
installing a new version of Mixxx. SCONS may not properly
overwrite your skins directory when you do a "scons install",
and it might cause Mixxx to crash on launch.
You can delete it by running:

   $ sudo rm -rf /usr/share/mixxx/skins
   $ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/mixxx/skins


* INSTALL **************************************************
Mixxx has the following dependencies:
- fftw3
- libid3tag
- libmad
- libogg
- libvorbis
- libvorbisfile
- libsndfile
- PortAudio-v19
- QT 4.4+
- scons

NOTE: If you want JACK support in Mixxx, make sure you 
compile PortAudio-v19 with JACK support first.

Mixxx's build system is now SCONS as of Mixxx 1.6.0. 
To compile Mixxx using SCONS, go into the "mixxx"
directory and run:

   $ scons
  
SCONS does both dependency checking and building, so it will
tell you if you're missing any of the dependencies listed above.
It's also possible to specify a prefix path and additional
build flags, for example:

   $ scons prefix=/usr 
   
To install Mixxx after compilation, run:

   $ sudo scons prefix=/usr install
